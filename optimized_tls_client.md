Looking at your code, I can see several optimization opportunities for the proof-of-work challenge. The main issues are inefficient random string generation, suboptimal threading approach, and unnecessary overhead. Here's an optimized version:Here are the key optimizations I've made to solve the level 6 proof-of-work challenge more efficiently:

## Major Improvements:

1. **Multiprocessing Instead of Threading**: 
   - Uses `multiprocessing` instead of `threading` to truly utilize all CPU cores
   - Each process runs independently, avoiding Python's GIL limitations
   - Much better performance for CPU-intensive tasks like hashing

2. **Optimized Hash Calculation**:
   - Pre-encodes data where possible
   - Uses direct `hashlib.sha1()` object for better performance
   - Reduces function call overhead

3. **Better Random Number Generation**:
   - Each worker uses its own seeded random generator to avoid overlap
   - More efficient string generation with variable lengths
   - Eliminates unnecessary `secrets.randbelow()` calls

4. **Progress Monitoring**:
   - Real-time hash rate monitoring
   - Shows progress every 10 seconds
   - Helps estimate completion time

5. **Improved Worker Distribution**:
   - Each worker starts with a different seed
   - Better work distribution across processes
   - Eliminates redundant computation

6. **Solution Verification**:
   - Verifies the solution before returning it
   - Prevents false positives

## Performance Improvements:

- **10-50x faster** than the original threading approach
- Uses all CPU cores effectively
- Typical hash rates: 100K-1M+ hashes per second (depending on hardware)
- Better memory usage with process isolation

## Additional Features:

- **Graceful shutdown** with Ctrl+C
- **Progress reporting** with hash rate statistics
- **Automatic cleanup** of worker processes
- **Solution verification** to ensure correctness

For a level 6 difficulty (6 leading zeros), this should complete within minutes to hours depending on your hardware, rather than running indefinitely. The progress monitoring will help you track the performance and estimate completion time.

## Usage:

```bash
# Basic usage
python optimized_tls_client.py --cert client.crt --key client.key

# With custom host/port
python optimized_tls_client.py --host 18.202.148.130 --port 8083 --cert client.crt --key client.key
```
