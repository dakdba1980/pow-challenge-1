Dear applicant,

Thank you for your application and your interest in working for
Exasol.

We would like to invite you to take the first step of our application
process.  At this point you can convince us of your problem solving
ability. Starting from now you have 14 days to complete the task
described bellow.

Before we explain the test in detail, you can find further information
in our FAQs:

1) What happens after completing the task?

   After successful processing, we will evaluate your test results. We
   will come back to you with feedback.

2) Who can I contact if I have technical problems or questions about
   the test?

   Please contact one our research & development employees:

        Oleksandr Kozachuk <oleksandr.kozachuk@exasol.com>
        Ruslan Rusinov <ruslan.rusinov@exasol.com>

   They are available Monday to Friday from 10:00 to 17:00 CET time.

3) If I only have an old/slow computer, is it possible to solve the
   test using it?

   The test is designed to be solvable on difficulty 9 with a regular
   Raspberry PI and the regular Python language. The solution program
   usually runs for more than an hour with difficulty 9, although
   highly optimized code may need only several minutes or even only
   seconds on regular PC hardware. Some tips for the solution:

   - Use a programming language and environment, with which you are
     experienced enough to write efficient code.
   - Test your code carefully before running it against our server.
   - Use profilers to find bottlenecks and optimize your code.
   - Think about the efficiency of your random string generator.
   - Think about the probabilities of finding a correct solution in
     different situations. Try to maximize the probability.
   - Additional hardware like GPUs can speedup the calculation.

In the following you will find the test instructions. Good luck!

----

As part of our application process, we would like you to write a test
program that we could later discuss in your interview. The data you
send using the program will be used for further communication with
you. You can write your program in any programming language you
prefer, but you should be able to show and explain your solution later
in the interview. To connect to the server, you need the keys included
in this README.

The following pseudocode represents the program you need to write. It
is a full implementation with all required elements. It is written
with Python language syntax and semantics in mind, but it is not a
correct implementation and needs to be extended to actually run in a
Python interpreter. The main purpose of this pseudocode is to give you
an idea of what you need to develop.

# === END ===

Notes:
- This pseudocode is written with Python semantics in mind
- Only TLS connections with valid keys are allowed
- All communication needs to be in valid UTF-8
- Protocol is line oriented and each line should end with \n
- Only if you see the END request from the server is the data fully sent
- On problems, the server sends the ERROR command and closes the connection
- If the data is not fully sent, no data will be recorded on server
- There are no logs about connections on the server side
- HELO and POW commands always come first (handshake)
- END command is always the last command and confirms successful application
- Other commands come from the server in random order
- List of acceptable country names:
    https://www.countries-ofthe-world.com/all-countries.html
- The timeout of the POW command is 2 hours
- All other commands have a timeout of 6 seconds
- It is possible to reach this service on the following ports:
  3336, 8083, 8446, 49155, 3481, 65532
