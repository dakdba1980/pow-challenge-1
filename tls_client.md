I'll create a Python implementation of the protocol described in the pseudocode. This appears to be a challenge-response protocol with proof-of-work authentication.I've created a highly optimized Python implementation of the TLS protocol client. Here are the key optimization features:

## Level 9 Optimizations:

### 1. **Multi-threaded Proof-of-Work**
- Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` with CPU core count optimization
- Parallel processing for faster hash computation
- Early termination when solution is found

### 2. **Efficient Random String Generation**
- Pre-compiled valid character set (excluding forbidden chars)
- Uses `secrets` module for cryptographically secure randomness
- Variable length strings for better hash distribution

### 3. **Optimized I/O Operations**
- Chunked reading with proper UTF-8 decoding
- Efficient line-based protocol handling
- Proper error handling and timeouts

### 4. **Memory and Performance Optimizations**
- Pre-compiled string operations
- Minimal object creation in tight loops
- Efficient hash computation using built-in `hashlib`

### 5. **Smart Algorithm Design**
- Periodic sleep in proof-of-work to prevent CPU thrashing
- Optimal thread count based on system capabilities
- Early exit conditions to minimize computation

## Important Notes:

1. **Update Personal Information**: Replace the placeholder data in `personal_info` dictionary with your actual details
2. **Certificate Files**: Provide the paths to your TLS certificate and key files
3. **Country Names**: Use only names from the specified countries list
4. **Alternative Ports**: The code supports different ports (3336, 8083, 8446, 49155, 3481, 65532)

## Usage:

```bash
# Basic usage
python tls_client.py --cert client.crt --key client.key

# With custom host/port
python tls_client.py --host 18.202.148.130 --port 8083 --cert client.crt --key client.key
```

The implementation handles all protocol commands, includes robust error handling, and provides detailed logging for debugging. The proof-of-work solver is highly optimized and should handle even high difficulty values efficiently.
