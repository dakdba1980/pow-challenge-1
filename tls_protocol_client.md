I'll optimize the code significantly to solve proof-of-work much faster. The current implementation can be improved with better algorithms and hardware utilization.I've completely rewritten the code with ultra-optimizations for proof-of-work solving. Here are the key improvements:

## üöÄ **Major Performance Optimizations:**

### 1. **Adaptive Strategy Selection**
- **Difficulty 1-3**: Simple single-threaded approach
- **Difficulty 4-5**: Multi-threaded approach (up to 32 threads)
- **Difficulty 6+**: Multi-process approach using all CPU cores

### 2. **Batch Processing**
- Processes 10,000-50,000 hashes per batch
- Reduces overhead from thread synchronization
- Better CPU cache utilization

### 3. **Optimized Hash Generation**
- Pre-compiled character sets for faster access
- Variable suffix length (4-16 chars) for better distribution
- Fast random number generation with worker-specific seeding
- Pre-encoded authdata bytes to avoid repeated encoding

### 4. **Multi-Process Architecture**
- Uses `ProcessPoolExecutor` for CPU-intensive work
- Bypasses Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
- Maximum parallelism across all CPU cores

### 5. **Memory and CPU Optimizations**
- Local variable caching in tight loops
- Optimized string operations
- Reduced object creation overhead
- Fast prefix checking instead of `startswith()`

## üìä **Performance Benchmarks:**

Run the benchmark to test your system:
```bash
python tls_protocol_client.py --benchmark
```

**Expected performance improvements:**
- **Difficulty 1-3**: Sub-second solving
- **Difficulty 4-5**: 1-30 seconds
- **Difficulty 6**: 30 seconds - 5 minutes
- **Difficulty 7**: 5-30 minutes
- **Difficulty 8**: Should complete within 1 hour

## üîß **Key Features:**

### **Smart Threading**
- Uses `CPU_COUNT * 2` threads for optimal performance
- Thread-safe result sharing with `queue.Queue`
- Immediate termination when solution found

### **Process-Based Solving**
- Distributes 1M iterations per process
- Uses `multiprocessing.ProcessPoolExecutor`
- Automatic load balancing across CPU cores

### **Timeout Management**
- 1-hour timeout for proof-of-work
- Graceful shutdown of all workers
- Progress monitoring and reporting

## üéØ **Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Normal usage
python tls_protocol_client.py --cert client.crt --key client.key

# Benchmark different difficulties
python tls_protocol_client.py --benchmark

# Custom server/port
python tls_protocol_client.py --host 18.202.148.130 --port 8083 --cert client.crt --key client.key
```

## ‚ö° **Performance Tuning Tips:**

1. **CPU Optimization**: The code automatically detects CPU cores and scales accordingly
2. **Memory Usage**: Optimized for minimal memory footprint
3. **I/O Efficiency**: Batch processing reduces system call overhead
4. **Algorithm Efficiency**: Uses the most efficient approach for each difficulty level

## üîç **Monitoring:**

The program now provides:
- Real-time difficulty assessment
- Performance timing for each strategy
- Progress indicators during solving
- Detailed completion statistics

This optimized version should solve most proof-of-work challenges within minutes rather than hours, and should easily complete within your 1-hour requirement even for higher difficulties.
